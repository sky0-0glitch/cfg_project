# 📊 GPA vs. Starting Salary Analysis

## 🎯 Goals
I aimed to demonstrate that **GPA does not significantly impact success or securing good jobs** by analyzing a dataset of **5,000 students** with varying **GPAs and starting salaries**.

## 🛠 Methodology
- **Dataset:** 5,000 students with **University GPA** and **Starting Salary**.
- **Visualization:** A **scatter plot** was used to display the relationship between GPA and salary.
- **Trend Line:** A regression line was added to observe any correlation.

## 📈 Key Findings
- The data suggests **no strong correlation** between GPA and starting salary.
- High salaries were observed across **a wide range of GPAs**.
- Other factors likely contribute **more significantly** to job success.

## 🔍 Visualization
- **Scatter plot** for clarity instead of line plots.
- **Transparency (alpha=0.2)** to handle data overlap.
- **Trend line** to highlight overall patterns.

## 🚀 Conclusion
This analysis challenges the traditional notion that **a higher GPA leads to better job opportunities** and emphasizes the importance of **skills, experience, and networking** in career success.
